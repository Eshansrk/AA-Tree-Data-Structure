# AA-Tree

An AA-Tree is a binary search tree with all the
ordering properties of a red-black tree: 

1. Every node is colored either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. External nodes are black.
4. If a node is red, its children must be black.
5. All paths from any node to a descendent leaf.
must contain the same number of black nodes.
(black-height, not including the node itself)
6. Left children may not be red!
